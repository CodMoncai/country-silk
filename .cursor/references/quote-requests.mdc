# Quote Requests via Email

When a theme needs quote requests (instead of checkout), use a mailto-based flow
so the admin can control the recipient email in theme settings.

## Pattern

- Add a theme setting for the destination email (`settings.quote_request_email`).
- Replace checkout CTA with a quote request form.
- Use a custom element and JavaScript to open a `mailto:` link.
- Include cart line items, totals, and optional cart note in the email body.
- Add the customer's email as a `cc` so they receive a copy.

## Required Translations

- Form text and helper copy under `locales/en.default.json` (e.g. `quotes.*`).
- Theme settings labels and info under `locales/en.default.schema.json`.

## Notes

- `mailto:` relies on the customer's email client. Provide a helper message
  explaining the email will open in their client and avoid displaying the admin email.
- Disable the request button if the admin email setting is blank.
